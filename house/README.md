I create this material, not with the purpose of competing, but of intended to cover most of the techniques of data analysis and ML in Python fro regression analysis. That is why it follows the natural flow of ML and contains many texts and links to the techniques, made your conference and references easy. as it can be extended over time.

In order not to fall into monotony, sometimes I take some liberties and apply a little humor, but nothing that compromises the accuracy of knowledge that is being acquired by the reader. Of course, anyone who wants to contribute some addition or even a claim or choreography will be very welcome. But what should you be thinking now? So, enough of tangle and let's go.
